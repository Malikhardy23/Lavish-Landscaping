                    My name is Michael Peters, owner of Lavish Landscaping and I want to thank you for visiting with us. I hope that you find the information here helpful. Choosing a landscape, tree or excavating company for your project is important, and as with all fields of services, all landscape, tree and excavating companies are not created equal. This is your home or business - a reflection of you, so it is important who you choose to work with. I believe you will find that we listen whether you just have a question about sod or irrigation, advice on plant selection or how much an entire landscape would cost.
                    <br>
